title: Aqaba â†’ Petra, Jordan
---

Date of travel: May 2023
- mini bus aqaba -> petra
the bus terminal is in ... a few mins walk from the princess salma park
the petra bus is usually a mini-bus (shuttle bus), with a sign saying Petra - Aqaba on the side of the bus, near the back
the bus leaves at around 10am (will most likely be late because they wait for it to get full-er), and the trip costs 7 jd (they'll drop you close to your hostel/hotel/wtv)
it's a loooong trip, although it's less than 150kms, because the driver will go at 80-100km/h, there's a bit of traffic and the roads are not great, with 2-3 stops along the way

note1: i saw some buses saying wadi rum - aqaba in the bus terminal, so i guess that's where those also leave from
note2: a lot of people seem to travel around jordan by renting a car, did not try that, but it's definitely a thing
