- land border crossing eliat -> aqaba
first thing you have to do is to pay the exit fee (cheaper for more people), which costs a bit over 30â‚¬/person
then you go through the border check, and off you go

walk a few meters into the jordanian border
I assume you got the jordan pass, which leads you to desk 13, where they'll just check the associated visa and print it for you
if you already have a copy of the visa, you go straight to 8, where they'll do the passport check, capture some biometrics, and off you go

before leaving, withdraw some jordanian dollars
