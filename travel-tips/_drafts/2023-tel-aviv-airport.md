## Relevant Info

Add an additional ~30 mins to your time, because you might get unlucky and go through additional security.

## Getting There

Take the train, it's the easiest. Takes 11 minutes from Tel Aviv HaHagana and 34 minutes from Jerusalem Yits'hak Navon. Trip costs 9 NIS (the bus+train daily pass is 18 NIS).

## Navigating the Maze of Terminal 3

Departures (security+boarding gates) are on the 3rd floor.

There's a luggage control before security. If you're a backpacker, and you only have carry-ons, you might get selected for a pre-security check, which happens at the oversized luggage zone (it's hidden in the middle of the check-in gates on the 3rd floor - left of the luggage control).

At the entrance of the regular security check, they'll want to see your luggage sticker, then you go through security - no need to remove liquids, just laptops/tablets (my power bank went through while inside a jacket in a bag).

After security, you'll go to passport control - most of it is for biometric passports, which is pretty fast, and then you're in the commercial area.

The end.
