- cairo airport -> downtown (egyptian museum)
most people take a taxi or a private minibus
a taxi will cost around 400-500 EGP
I don''t know about minibuses (they usually only allow drops at points in a specific route)
the public bus costs 6 EGP (cash only), but you have to walk about 15 mins to the bus terminal
