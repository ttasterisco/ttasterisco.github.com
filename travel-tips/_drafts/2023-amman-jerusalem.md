title: Amman, Jordan â†’ Jerusalem, Israel
---

Date of travel: May 2023
- amman - jerusalem
jett bus to king hussein bridge (leaves at 7:00 but be at 6:45 in abdali)

now comes the fun part
grab one of the small forms, fill it
go to departures (far desk on the right)
go to the customs office and pay 10 jd for 2 "stamps"
go to passport control and they'll take your passport, form, and stamp
now you can go board the shuttle which is in front of where you got dropped off (it's full of mosquitoes..)
before the bus departs, the police comes with the passport and the form and the stamp
then you have to pay the bus ticket 7 jd + 1.5 jd per luggage item
bus departs once it's "full"
midway, the military will come and check the documents, they'll take 1 of the stamps and the form (you'll keep the other stamp)

then you'll wait for a while because there's gonna be a large queue of trucks and buses to get into israel

once you're out of the bus, you'll be in the israeli side
if you're just bringing a backpack, then make sure you go to the clerk on the left side, outside of the queuing corridor - it's for people who only have backpacks, and you'll be able to skip the long queue for people with luggage
then you'll go into the normal security check
then you'll go through passport check (seems like arab people have a dedicated queue clerk for them)
then you'll go through a final check, and you're out of the border control, and into the parking lot

it seems like the only way to get to jerusalem is to take a shared mini-bus that costs approximately 50 shekels/person; you can buy the tickets in the booth that says TAXI, the bus will leave once full; it will drop you near herod's gate in the old city of jerusalem (muslim quarter)

note: there's another booth that takes you to jericho, but I have no experience with it
