title: Aqaba Border â†’ Aqaba City Center, Jordan
---

Date of travel: May 2023

So, you got to Jordan through the land border with Israel, and now you need to get to the City Center. 

While there's a list with the official taxi prices, the drivers don't really care about that! You'll have to negotiate a rate with the drivers.

We paid 15 JD to get to the city center.
