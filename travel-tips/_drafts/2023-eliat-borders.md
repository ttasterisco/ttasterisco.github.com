- border to border in eliat
welcome to israel, now you need to find a way to get to jordanian border
I got an expensive taxi for 90 shekels (~25 euros), but there might be cheaper options (didn't check cause my friends were too tired, lmao)
to be fair, it takes a while to get to the border (about 20 mins by car)
