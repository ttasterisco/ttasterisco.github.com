- petra - back entrance
you can get a free shuttle to little petra (last one is at 15:00)
then you can walk for ~2 hrs to the monastery or pay to get into a 4x4 truck (don't know how much)

we got a 4x4 "taxi" for 15 jd (5 jd each, he was originally asking for 10 jd/person, group of 3)
took like 20-30 mins to get to the back entrance because the driver took a very long detour (not sure why)
saw some people arrived by taxi and private bus
