So you wanna cross the Egypt/Israel land border?

You have to pay for exit stamps from Egypt (15 EGP?), fill a form, and give it to the border exit.
Then you walk a few meters into the Israel entry border check, where you give them your passport at the entrance, go through security, where you'll get the passport back, then head to passport control.

PS: get some shekels from the ATM before leaving the building.
