Most people take a taxi or a private minibus to get to the city center. A taxi will cost around 400-500 EGP, and I don''t know about minibuses (they usually only allow drops at points in a specific route).

But there's a public bus, that only costs 6 EGP (cash only), but you have to walk around 15 mins to the bus terminal (which is pretty easy to find in Google Maps). Note: You'll probably get honked a few times by taxis.

The trip is light (might smell a bit of diesel), and takes quite a bit (~1 hr - I stopped by the Egyptian Museum). You can just ask the driver to stop in the "next" stop, wherever that is.
