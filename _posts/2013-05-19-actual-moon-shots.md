Moonshot. The buzzword of 2013.

[You]() [see]() [it]() [every]()[-]()[single]()[-]()[where]().

But most of these are not even close. I mean, come on!

- delivering stuff with drones?
- collaborative editing?
- bad example of moonshot 1
- bad example of moonshot 2
- bad example of moonshot 3
- ...


How about some actual moonshots?

The human being should aim for «being» omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent. Yes, Gods.
Add omnibenevolent to the mix if you feel like it.


* Instead of delivering things with drones, how about having what you want instantaneously
in front of you?

1. Pick the thing
2. Have it materialized in front of you.

But how would such a thing work? I don't know. Maybe you go to the futuristic equivalent
of Amazon, hit select, the necessary resources are sent over the wire/air/whatever to your
location's materializer (how about a 3D printer?) and in a blink of an eye it's ready.
Sure, we have to solve a billion sub-problems until something like this is possible, but
that's your actual moonshot.



* Instead of MOOCs, how about instant knowledge in your brain?
Wanna learn how to code in clojure? Just click this button and have something introduced into
your body (a pill, hook up a cable into your brain, whatever).
Yes, we have to solve some millenial problems such as defining what knowledge is or how to be
materialized into something physical that our body can understand. Or how to
make it fundamentally copyable to everyone (not just words, but actual chemical formula that
when introduced into your body make you just know). that's your actual moonshot.



* Instead of developing autonomous cars or building your own airport to take you somewhere,
how about (yes, you guessed it) teleportation?



* Instead of an etherpad or a google wave, how about really solving collaboration? How about







* how about mobile affordable and easy to transport homes?
not caravans - make it really easy to move around and transport your belongings

not tents - we want a bit more of comfort

this could solve housing problems for the yuppie

save major money and give a level of freedom that was never seen before

wanna live a few months or years in thailand? done. or maybe in tibet? done.

you know, like dragon ball z's capsules. sure, if we could print things on demand, there shouldn't
be a need for "ownership", but still, human beings have a tendency to attachment




* if we're gonna be driving cars, then please please please make them smarter
you can begin with a smart display. you know, use that big transparent piece of glass in front of us
do something more than... nothing! instead of me having to look at my smartphone or my gps for directions
how about making them appear directly in front of me, in the screen that I'm already looking at?


* a prediction/intention machine! yes, just like minority report or even better, like fringe where the
guy can calculate the probabilities of events, just like the observers can! that's the real power of
data, to be able to know the future. and with enough data.. you just might be able to do so


* human++ - let's start enhancing our bodies for real. I'd like telekinesis for a start. that cup is
too far away, I wanna just do a gesture with my hand and have the cup come to me. where are my keys?
keys: show yourself! you get the drill

* control the weather

* stop waste/trash



The irony of this post has not been lost.

Pseudo-Addendum:

Blah blah blah yada yada yada, I agree that Google's moonshots are awesome and great and will
have a tremendous impact in the world in the next decades to come. And they are solving hard
problems which will innevitably open the doors to some other creations.
