Moonshot. The buzzword of 2013.

[You]() [see]() [it]() [every]()[-]()[single]()[-]()[where]().

But most of these are not even close. I mean, come on!

- delivering stuff with drones?
- collaborative editing?
- bad example of moonshot 1
- bad example of moonshot 2
- bad example of moonshot 3
- ...


How about some actual moonshots?

The human being should aim for «being» omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent. Yes, Gods.
Add omnibenevolent to the mix if you feel like it.


* Instead of delivering things with drones, how about having what you want instantaneously
in front of you?

1. Pick the thing
2. Have it materialized in front of you.

But how would such a thing work? I don't know. Maybe you go to the futuristic equivalent
of Amazon, hit select, the necessary resources are sent over the wire/air/whatever to your
location's materializer (how about a 3D printer?) and in a blink of an eye it's ready.
Sure, we have to solve a billion sub-problems until something like this is possible, but
that's your actual moonshot.



* Instead of MOOCs, how about instant knowledge in your brain?
Wanna learn how to code in clojure? Just click this button and have something introduced into
your body (a pill, hook up a cable into your brain, whatever).
Yes, we have to solve some millenial problems such as defining what knowledge is. Or how to
make it fundamentally copyable to everyone (like not just words, but into actual chemical
things that when injected into your body make you just know).
that's your actual moonshot.



* Instead of developing autonomous cars or building your own airport to take you somewhere,
how about (yes, you guessed it) teleportation?



* Instead of an etherpad or a google wave, how about really solvign collaboration? How about







* how about mobile affordable and easy to transport homes?
not caravans - make it really easy to move around and transport your belongings
not tents - we want a bit more of comfort
this could solve housing problems for the yuppie
save major money and give a level of freedom that was never seen before
wanna live a few months or years in thailand? done. or maybe in tibet? done.
you know, like dragon ball z's capsules. sure, if we could print things on demand, there shouldn't
be a need for "ownership", but still, human beings have a tendency to attachment








The irony of this post has not been lost.

Pseudo-Addendum:

I agree that Google's moonshots are awesome and great and will have a tremendous impact in the
world in the next decades to come. And they are solving hard problems which will innevitably
open the doors to some other creations.
