title: Identity and Anonimity

Fred Wilson's post about Deep Web Markets reminded me of something I've had buried deep in my mind (heh)

Managing identity and anonimity

what is the identity?
my name, age, other personal details
my reputation - authority in terms of different subjects
e.g. seller reputation, buyer reputation, knowledge reputation, yelp reviewer, etc etc

I don't want people to know who I am

But I want them to know I'm trustworthy (reputation)

certain activities require the other party to know who you are
but other (most?) activities don't

Just because I might not show my face on Tinder/OkCupid/etc, does that mean I'm some dangerous creep and I'm automatically not worthy of being shown in the listing or able to use the service?
What about selling?

ebay doesn't require you to give out your identity in order for others to know if you're trustworthy or not
maybe because they were invented back in the 90s

how can we carry our identity around the web and provide parts of it to be used in services
but without giving out everything
a new marketplace popped up? here's my reputation built from years selling on ebay and olx and other reputable marketplaces and load it into the system
I'm a programmer and I'm offering my services to a new freelancing website

identity management
openid has failed

what about using something like the blockchain?
means your identity must sit on top of the blockchain and must be altered through it
increasing/decreasing reputation, etc


many challenges
keeping things private
ignoring false profiles
etc etc


will something like this make the price of bitcoin go up?
