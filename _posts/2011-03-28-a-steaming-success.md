title: A Steaming Success
summary: An analysis on Steam.

Ah.. Steam. One of those late bloomers.

I recall when Steam was released in the early 2000s by Valve, forcing every single CounterStrike player into it. Yells of revolt were heard, people in IRC and forums were all pissed "Why Valve? Why?".

Fast forward and what do we see? Steam looks like a "Great Success". A lot of big publishers have finally jumped on board and Steam now sells more than the Valve games. Big names arrive quickly to the system, indie devs are publishing there, a huge selection of titles and easy access by users.

But IMHO, the biggest thing going for Steam looks like the catching of the long tail. Steam is kind of becoming the iTunes for games. Obscure indie games that would probably go unnoticed get a lot of exposure. Steam promotions are usually a big hit. Special X-days promotions for < $5. Buy this pack for $10. With those, they can promote some not-so-successful titles and try and gather some hype.

And they've diversified into Mac and now Linux.


But why hasnâ€™t Valve launched an iOS/Android app?
