the impact that society has on individuals and their choices

experiment:
- imagine that we possess the technology to control the chemical levels on humans in a way that we can make them change their tastes, sexual orientation, moral stances, etc
- this technology has been proven to work on lab experiments
- but what happens when individuals are placed back on their original environment?
- will they suddenly revert back to their old selves?
- will they completely change due to their brain rewiring?
- can they be reverted?
