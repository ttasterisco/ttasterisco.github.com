Year 2222

Billionaire Nathaniel Stark is preparing for his voyage. Aged 56, this young fellow is brimming with excitement while he steps into the capsule. Destination? Unknown.

- see Cosmopolis
- a voyage through the stars, in a capsule that sustains his life
- he can entertain himself with (very) long range communication, a “matrix” of his own or simply a beautiful sightseeing
- how it is the same on every single lone trip: be it through europe or through the stars
- introspection
- there actually is a goal, unknown to everyone but to the voyager - the answer to life, the universe and everything
