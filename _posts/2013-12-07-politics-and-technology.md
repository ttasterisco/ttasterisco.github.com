summary: .
---

politics need to step up and learn how to deal with technology
dealing with the present and fixing problems of the present is not enough

how do things work with remote work?
how will things work when we get teleportation?

the notion of state is eroding and needs to be fixed/replaced














the future of citizenship
goodbye governments
hello always-on democracy
analytics, free information flowing, public forums
decisions will still be influenced by a few
everyone logs at a set time to vote
