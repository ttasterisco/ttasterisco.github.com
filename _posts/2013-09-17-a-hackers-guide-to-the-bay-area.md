## Geography
<img src="/resources/2013-09-17-a-hackers-guide-to-the-bay-area/01-bay-area.png" />

The San Francisco Bay Area is a region in Northern California (NorCal). /origin of the name?/
tell some facts about the bay area

Silicon Valley is the name used to reference the southern part of the Bay.
At the top of the southern peninsula is the city of San Francisco.
East of the Bay is home to the famous cities of Oakland and Berkeley.

### <a id="geo-sv"> </a> Silicon Valley
Silicon Valley is not a specific town. It is a fairly wide region in the Southern part of the Bay Area.
Ground zero is the Santa Clara Valley. Over the years, the name has been used to reference the area that stretches from
... to San Jose. In recent years, it has been common to mean San Francisco as part of the Valley.

The Valley can be dividied into 3 different areas:
* The *older* part of the valley - Santa Clara, San Jose, Cupertino, Sunnyvale.
* The *new burgois* - Menlo Park, Palo Alto, Stanford, Mountain View
* The *upcoming* - San Mateo, Redwood City

/this is my own classification/

### Transportation
The MUNI is San Francisco's major public transportation system, covering most of the town with its buses and a few metropolitan-like trains. Unfortunately it is not the most reliable system, so it is not uncommon to experience random delays. A ride on the MUNI costs $2 and you can hop onto any ride for 3hrs??? after you bought the ticket.

The BART is the train system that connects (mainly) San Francisco and the East Bay. It ranges from Millbrae and the San Francisco Airport (SFO) to the far ends of the East Bay (Fremont, Dublin/Pleasanton, Pittsburg/Bay Point and Richmond).

The Caltrain is the train system that connects the South Bay and Peninsula to San Francisco. It ranges from San Jose to the SOMA district (4th Street and King). It is widely used, always being packed during rush hours. Some of the trains are bullet trains, meaning that they don't stop at all stops. The Caltrain stops running at around 11pm, except on Sundays, where the last train ends at 9pm.

Due to these reasons, it is understandable the rise of ride-sharing/private taxi transportation systems, i.e. Uber, Zipcar, Lyft, etc.

Traffic in the Bay Area can seem strange at first sight. It's one of the few places where, in the morning, the traffic jams from the City to the Suburbs and, in afternoon, from the Suburbs to the City.

A lot of people live in the City and commute to the Peninsula/South Bay to work. Caltrain is always packed during rush hours.

If you're going to SF, only take the car as a last resort. More than the traffic, parking is a big pain. Hard to find and very expensive in parking garages. How expensive? This expensive:
