title: A Strategy for Beating Google in their Own Turf
summary: How Google Search Might Get "Disrupted"
---

- you cant go head to head with google search
- they own the long tail
- some (most?) people keep visiting the same domains for their
results: eg stackoverflow, blogs, news websites, videos, lyrics,
sports, gaming
- "unbundle search"
- index specific domains and provide better search tools for them
- 80/20
- eg twitter's search sucks, searching for specific media in tumblr
(images), time-related searches, etc
- acquire users by attaching your service into those domains (eg
swifttype's model)
- suddenly google gets scared

pinterest? good model for search
unbundle
not optimal for everything
but very good for a lot of things
