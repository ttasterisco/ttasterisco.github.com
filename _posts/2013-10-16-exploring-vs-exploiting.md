title: Startups: Exploring vs Exploiting
summary:
---

we are in an industry that assumes risk
that knows that 90% of its investments will fail
yet, why do we take the safe route?

why do we aim low?
when we're able to get the tools for success, why do we take the same old route?

why don't we try something different?
why stay in the comfort zone?

are we really so clueless at understanding what's going to be successful at the seed/idea level?
if it's all a matter of execution, why does everyone aim to execute the same old way, even when the probability is that it will lead to failure?

am I biased (survivor's bias) in my analysis?

don't be the tree that falls in the forest when no one is around.
impact the world, even when failing
