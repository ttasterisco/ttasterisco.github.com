The Pull Web
Google’s paradigm
people access the services when they need to
e.g. search engines

The Push Web
the paradigm of modern social networks (twitter/facebook/anything with a feed/wall
contents are sent to you
hardly any choice on what gets received (unfiltered content - apart from basic hide/block)

It’s not about social
it doesn’t matter from who it’s from
it’s all about the message
I might be not interested by certain content sent from friends
even though other content sent by the same friends might be of interest to me

It’s about topical
best resembles rss, where people subscribe certain feeds
but feeds act like people, when used in general sites
modern filters should be topic based
automatic tagging
tagging allows multiple categorization
abstracts the person-element (but it doesn’t remove it, just turns it into an instance)

social will live on
sharing private life stuff
photos, etc

Pull vs Push / Searching vs Tagging
yes, two faces of the same coin
pull will continue
pull will surpass the “social” web

Search + Tagging
pull can largely benefit from tagging
it structures/organizes the web (yahoo-like)
better discovery experience (finding related stuff, filtering search results)
watch out for blekko
