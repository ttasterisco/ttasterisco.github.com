an exercise in what if
the impact of technology and capitalism in humanity
driving the cost of goods to zero
a guaranteed income to all humanity
"no jobs"
the future of "work"



in a future where, genetic manipulation is common, where we can increase our brainpower and memory, what's going to happen to humanity as a whole?
convergence, divergence? both, how?







remember those futurist images of dense tall cities scraping the skies?
the engineers have done their job to make it possible
it is the politics that isn't up to the task
