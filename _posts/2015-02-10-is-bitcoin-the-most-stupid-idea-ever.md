title: Is Bitcoin the Most Stupid Idea Ever?
summary: Because you should be self critical.

A decentralized digital crypto currency.

No central bank or governmental institution controlling the currency.
open to economy hijack from other entities (countries and/or private groups)
unable to print money

It serves no purpose in terms of computation
the cycles are just wasted
