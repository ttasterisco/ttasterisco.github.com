title: Can Anyone Beat Facebook?
summary:
---

just like google in search, facebook has social locked in.

but just like google, it's not #1 in russia and china. government interference? but what about japan? http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/technology/10facebook.html?pagewanted=all

can russia/china teach us something to fight against facebook?

there's a pattern on #2 and #3 in australia, canada, france, germany, uk, etc - it belongs to twitter and|or linkedin. why? what's happening?

the rise of tumblr - is facebook losing it's #1-place-to-share-things crown?

emergence of people using microblogging to share stuff.
asynchronous following model (twitter-like) is very cool.
interaction with lot's of anonymous people.
and apparently alot of people want that.

facebook is not perfect
- look at facebook pages
- look at facebook posts/wall and than look at tumblr/friendfeed/new twitter
- look at facebook search

where does facebook have users engaged?
- games
- it's got your social graph and it's not gonna let it go
- it's become a household name like Google - everybody recognizes the brand
- chat
- pictures

what does facebook fear?
- losing your attention: please leave that tab open with facebook logged in
- nothing else. lots of attention = lots of pageviews = lots of ads = lots of cash
they think they own social. but do they?












Facebook's strategy

Diversification
leveraging the user base




groups

discussion - reddit
music
movies


chasing instead of leading

buying true talent (trendsetters and thought leaders)
