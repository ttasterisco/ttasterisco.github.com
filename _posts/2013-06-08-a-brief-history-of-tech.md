## 1970s
X (20-30?) years ago, computers became widespread in the workdesk of every kind of worker. It was no longer the toy of hobbyists nor the machine that only huge companies used. Now, it was on the desk of your secretary. The computer had immediate use for pretty much anyone.

But what did computers came to replace? And What did computers came to enable?

Typing machine/handwriting.
Hand-made spreadsheets.
(...)
Powerpoint presentations.
(...)

## 1980-90s
As the computer revolution spread across different professions and as the first software revolution took place, each kind of work found different use cases.The software revolution allowed Big Corps to manage their information across the whole spectrum. This gave rise to Oracle, SAP and kept powering IBM's growth. Cisco. Apple. Sun Microsystems.

Designers/Illustrators/etc came to embrace the tools developed by Adobe, Macromedia, Corel, etc
Other professions: ...

But the biggest? winner was clearly Microsoft, who's growth came not only from selling their operating system to both companies and home users, but also from their Enterprise side. Their ecosystem of tools for developers and companies to create customized software gave them pretty much unlimited power.

## 1995-2000s

### The internet revolution
The world saw the most powerful manifestation of the tech sector in the second half of the 90s. The internet became mainstream. The 2nd generation tech giants were born (eBay, Amazon, Yahoo, Netscape, Google). But the big bang (heh) was the dotcom crash, with repercussions around the world.

### The Open Source revolution
At the same time as the internet revolution happened, another revolution that would only manifest a few years after, was quietly brewing. The internet came to power a tremendous collaborative effort around the world: Open Source Software. Linux, the epitome and most known project, was started in the early 90s. It was relatively popular between techies in the late 90s. But the actual explosion came at the end of the 90s/beginning of 2000 when the LAMP stack began to be popularized. The other 3 letters? Apache (which came to name the Apache Foundation that now nurtures many OSS projects such as Lucene/Solr, Cassandra, Cordova aka PhoneGap, etc etc), MySQL and PHP (or Perl or Python or whatever).

Wikipedia is perhaps the most famous child of the marriage between the internet and the open source revolutions. What first was dismissed by many academics as a toy, viewed by Enciclopedia Britannica as "crap", quietly sailed through everything to become the most reliable source of knowledge in the world. Does anybody remember Microsoft Encarta?

The death of Netscape brought us the Mozilla Foundation, the big responsible for Microsoft's non-dominance in the Web until the arise of the current Web Giants.

## 2000s+

### Web 2.0 AKA Advertising, Blogs and the Social revolution
As expected, there was a period of calm immediately after the dotcom crash. But action was still happening. The internet was growing and with it, Google's dominance. The big lesson was the web business model for web companies: Advertising. That was the model to be for any web startup that was born during these years.

A big revolution reached its height in 200x: blogging (word of the year).

As much as I dislike the social revolution, I have to accept its existence. Myspace, hi5, Last.fm, Youtube, tumblr, Facebook and twitter made a tremendous impact on how we use the web. From portals

### Sshhh

Microsoft's dominance continued to manifest, but not where you'd expect. They were mostly busy with a big lawsuit that would drag them for years and a few big name failed products: Windows Millenium and Windows Vista. But that did not matter too much for them, for their biggest growth was in the Corporate world. Developers, developers, developers, remember? And why? In order to build the IT systems for SMB and LBs, using the Microsoft stack (SQL Server/.NET framework/Sharepoint/Windows/Office).

But do you know who was reborn during this period? Apple. The almost dead company, that took a loan from Microsoft, was quietly doing their big comeback. The infamous ipod, dismissed by techies as something too big, expensive and that did not even support mp3 was an unexpected success for many. They quickly capitalized on this. Then came the iPhone. And then the iPad. And they captured the developer world when they announced the change to intel architecture. Suddenly thousands were able to run Windows and (a superior) Mac OS X on the same machine!

## Present Day

### The internet is not dead yet
kickstarter (the company eBay should buy)

github


### Mobile, Mobile, Mobile
Google/Android and Apple/iOS



Why we don't hear about companies like Workday
It's because they serve a niche. A very profitable niche, no doubt about it, but still a niche. Their products do not impact the mainstream. Even if they enablers to others who do have great impact in the world, they do not. This is not a matter of good or bad. It's simply a choice, and I'm sure there are many who would not mind having the millions of dollars they have in revenue.
