title: Moving Fast and Breaking Things
summary:

linkbait title?
when a giant tries to move fast



anyway, the point is
successful startups don't grow _that_ fast
data to support this argument (instagram, facebook, whatsapp, etc)



but when a startup becomes successful and large
we all tell the tale of how they stop innovating
google hasn't released a successful product since X
facebook hasn't released a successful product
twitter hasn't released a successful product
yahoo ...
they now have to buy startups
etc

the question is why
are they trying to move too fast and forgetting their past, where they actually grew slowly?
would facebook buy facebook when they only had harvard? (maybe? did myspace try?)

copycat products
facebook is an expert

end of the day is that failure is the default and success is not a general case?
