title: Can Anyone Beat Google?
summary:
---

XX marketshare
worldwide dominance
most local search engines outsource to Google/Bing/XXX

but where doesn't google win?
China/Baidu. Russia/Yandex. Are they #1 because they are supported by the Power, or because they're better?
is there an opportunity for regional-based search engines? English, Chinese, Russian, French, German, Portuguese/Brazilian, etc search engines >>> Generic Search Engine?

what about those newcomers (e.g. blekko, duck duck go, bing v2, etc)?
they "change" the way  you search. they change the search experience. can they actually hurt google?
