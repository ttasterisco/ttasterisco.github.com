this post http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html made me think if we could use a transformation based process over markdown
what kinds of transformations would I want to see? paragraph adjusting, font adjusting, etc - but these are all applicable through css (which are transformations)
maybe more advanced stuff, like graph generation?

the idea would be something like:

markdown source - transformation 1 - transformation 2 - ... - end html/whatever output

i.e. markdown as source code
