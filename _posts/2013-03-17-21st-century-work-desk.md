In my opinion, the next most transformative change in the software revolution will be in how we use software for work. We are currently seeing manifestations of this revolution in the form of "enterprise startups", BYOD, mobile and the "consumerization of enterprise software".

Why do I claim such a thing? Take a look at [A Brief History of Computer Technology]().

First of all, I am not claiming that we are going to see changes in terms of the IT systems of companies. No (not yet), the change I'm talking about will be on the side of the workers. This is the first generation that grew up on the web and on cell phones. The new arrivals to the workforce are IT-educated and are not frightened to try new tools. Change will come from the inside because companies have become infected. The perfect Trojan Horse.

So what kind of enterprise software revolution are we talking about? As I see it, the big winners will be products that are transversal to people, that do not have to fit any special kind of use case and can be easily accessible. The smaller winners will be industry specific products, that can be quickly adopted by people.

Remmber: Companies move slowly when changing their IT systems. But individuals are fast(-er). And they'll move mountains to be able to use the things they want on their computers and/or phones (remember when companies used to block instant messaging).

Workers whose main capital is knowledge have to deal with a lot of communication.

## Knowledge workers in the 20th Century (up until the 90s)
A lot of people in the world still have something resembling this:

## Knowledge workers from 1990+
Those that have migrated to the digital world have things that look like this:

combined with

and tons of other documents laying around (pdfs, excels, docs, tabs open in the browser). Paper got replaced by email and attachments. And it probably got worse due to the low cost of the digital goods.

the direction the world <s>is taking</s> has taken is towards the web.
gmail, google drive, box, salesforce, evernote, yammer, etc

file manager
email
chat
text processor
spreadsheet
presentation tool
pdf viewer
search engine


## We don't work alone

No one does. Not even you, lonely writer. You still have an editor to report to. A graphic designer to talk with asking for something to color your text. Neither do you, lonely musician. etc etc

That's why <s>social</s> collaborative has become such a thing. We work in a collaborative way, communicating with different people in the different parts of our workflow.


## The importance of email

communication is the central element in all this

that's why email will stick around - it's the best at allowing people to communicate freely. yes, it can be simplified. and it will and that's why many startups are limpeting into it


## A Task as a unit of Work
so what is a task? it is this highly subjective thing that has to be done

it is natural that these startups are tackling this problem by starting at this generic element

but the evolution will, of course, be towards something bigger

the battle between asana, dropbox and evernote seems inevitable
they are all marching towards the same end


## Trends in Work

proliferation of task management system startups must mean something

there's asana, mail/dropbox, any.do, do.com, etc etc

many are trying to cater for what's now called "enterprise"

there's clearly a trend here, but what's the real deal? (get some data - number of startups in task management, etc)

many are tied to (or will be) email.

in my opinion, the real deal is the creation of the modern equivalent of the work desk.


## The Challengers

### Salesforce, Jive


### Yammer/Microsoft


### Dropbox, Evernote, Asana, Trello


### et al
Wunderlist (lol but it has 1M android!), etc


## Automation

the real value is in automation

and integration with other systems

it should help the worker become more efficient. better organized. easy to know what's happening.
like twitter is the pulse of the internet, a well designed workdesk should be the pulse of my work life.
how? dashboards. overview of everything.


help you with a ever-more multi-tasking world
it's no longer self control. it's getting imposed. multiple tasks at hand
how cool would it be to have something save the state of whatever you were doing and then switch to another state
when you came back, you would be easily reminded of where you where and what you had to do next


## The Future

I won't dwelve into how the modern work desk should look like, but there are a few characteristics.

mobile mobile mobile: well, duh

will a one size fit all solution work? or will the solutions be segmented / tailored to specific types of professions?

I can say that a good example comes from [close.io](http://close.io). It's specifically directed to sales people
but it shows how good and useful a dashboard for a professional will look like.

github is an example of the work desk for software developers

webrtc (voice, video and p2p sharing)

?

As for the rest, I'll leave it to your imagination


As someone did not say: "I predict the future by learning from the mistakes of the past."
