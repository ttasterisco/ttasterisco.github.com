title: The Battle for the 21st Century Work Desk

In my opinion, the next most transformative change in the software revolution will be in how we use software for work. We are currently seeing manifestations of this revolution in the form of "enterprise startups", BYOD, mobile and the "consumerization of enterprise software".

## 1970s
X (20-30?) years ago, computers became widespread in the workdesk of every kind of worker. It was no longer the toy of hobbyists nor the machine that only huge companies used. Now, it was on the desk of your secretary. The computer had immediate use for pretty much anyone.

But what did computers came to replace? And What did computers came to enable?

Typing machine/handwriting.
Hand-made spreadsheets.
(...)
Powerpoint presentations.
(...)

## 1980-90s
As the computer revolution spread across different professions and as the first software revolution took place, each kind of work found different use cases.The software revolution allowed Big Corps to manage their information across the whole spectrum. This gave rise to Oracle, SAP and kept powering IBM's growth. Cisco. Apple. Sun Microsystems.

Designers/Illustrators/etc came to embrace the tools developed by Adobe, Macromedia, Corel, etc
Other professions: ...

But the biggest? winner was clearly Microsoft, who's growth came not only from selling their operating system to both companies and home users, but also from their Enterprise side. Their ecosystem of tools for developers and companies to create customized software gave them pretty much unlimited power.

## 1995-2000s

### The internet revolution
The world saw the most powerful manifestation of the tech sector in the second half of the 90s. The internet became mainstream. The 2nd generation tech giants were born (eBay, Amazon, Yahoo, Netscape, Google). But the big bang (heh) was the dotcom crash, with repercussions around the world.

### The Open Source revolution
At the same time as the internet revolution happened, another revolution that would only manifest a few years after, was quietly brewing. The internet came to power a tremendous collaborative effort around the world: Open Source Software. Linux, the epitome and most known project, was started in the early 90s. It was relatively popular between techies in the late 90s. But the actual explosion came at the end of the 90s/beginning of 2000 when the LAMP stack began to be popularized. The other 3 letters? Apache (which came to name the Apache Foundation that now nurtures many OSS projects such as Lucene/Solr, Cassandra, Cordova aka PhoneGap, etc etc), MySQL and PHP (or Perl or Python or whatever).

Wikipedia is perhaps the most famous child of the marriage between the internet and the open source revolutions. What first was dismissed by many academics as a toy, viewed by Enciclopedia Britannica as "crap", quietly sailed through everything to become the most reliable source of knowledge in the world. Does anybody remember Microsoft Encarta?

The death of Netscape brought us the Mozilla Foundation, the big responsible for Microsoft's non-dominance in the Web until the arise of the current Web Giants.

## 2000s+

### Web 2.0 AKA Advertising, Blogs and the Social revolution
As expected, there was a period of calm immediately after the dotcom crash. But action was still happening. The internet was growing and with it, Google's dominance. The big lesson was the web business model for web companies: Advertising. That was the model to be for any web startup that was born during these years.

A big revolution reached its height in 200x: blogging (word of the year).

As much as I dislike the social revolution, I have to accept its existence. Myspace, hi5, Last.fm, Youtube, tumblr, Facebook and twitter made a tremendous impact on how we use the web. From portals

### Sshhh

Microsoft's dominance continued to manifest, but not where you'd expect. They were mostly busy with a big lawsuit that would drag them for years and a few big name failed products: Windows Millenium and Windows Vista. But that did not matter too much for them, for their biggest growth was in the Corporate world. Developers, developers, developers, remember? And why? In order to build the IT systems for SMB and LBs, using the Microsoft stack (SQL Server/.NET framework/Sharepoint/Windows/Office).

But do you know who was reborn during this period? Apple. The almost dead company, that took a loan from Microsoft, was quietly doing their big comeback. The infamous ipod, dismissed by techies as something too big, expensive and that did not even support mp3 was an unexpected success for many. They quickly capitalized on this. Then came the iPhone. And then the iPad. And they captured the developer world when they announced the change to intel architecture. Suddenly thousands were able to run Windows and (a superior) Mac OS X on the same machine!

## Present Day

### The internet is not dead yet
kickstarter (the company eBay should buy)

github


### Mobile, Mobile, Mobile
Google/Android and Apple/iOS



Why we don't hear about companies like Workday
It's because they serve a niche. A very profitable niche, no doubt about it, but still a niche. Their products do not impact the mainstream. Even if they enablers to others who do have great impact in the world, they do not. This is not a matter of good or bad. It's simply a choice, and I'm sure there are many who would not mind having the millions of dollars they have in revenue.

## Knowledge workers in the 20th Century (up until the 90s)

a lot of people in the world still have something resembling this:

## Knowledge workers from 1990+

those that have migrated to the digital world look like this (actually they might be using outlook):

<img src="http://jenniedorris.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/inbox.png" height="600" width="800" />

combined with

<img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OLJtve5MWL8/TCbpfHdpqTI/AAAAAAAAACw/AlhveIQ1Cqw/s1600/Desktop+001.jpg" height="600" width="800" />

and tons of other documents laying around (pdfs, excels, docs, tabs open in the browser)

the low cost of the digital goods amplifies the old-world problems immensely

the direction the world <s>is taking</s> has taken is towards the web.
gmail, google drive, box, salesforce, evernote, yammer, etc

## We don't work alone

No one does. Not even you, lonely writer. You still have an editor to report to. A graphic designer to talk with asking for something to color your text. Neither do you, lonely musician. etc etc

That's why <s>social</s> collaborative has become such a common work. We work in a collaborative way, communicating with different people in the different parts of our workflow.


## The importance of email

communication is the central element in all this

that's why email will stick around - it's the best at allowing people to communicate freely. yes, it can be simplified. and it will and that's why many startups are limpeting into it

## A Task as a unit of Work
so what is a task? it is this highly subjective thing that has to be done

it is natural that these startups are tackling this problem by starting at this generic element

but the evolution will, of course, be towards something bigger

the battle between asana, dropbox and evernote seems inevitable
they are all marching towards the same end


## Trends in Work

proliferation of task management system startups must mean something

there's asana, mail/dropbox, any.do, do.com, etc etc

many are trying to cater for what's now called "enterprise"

there's clearly a trend here, but what's the real deal? (get some data - number of startups in task management, etc)

many are tied to (or will be) email.

in my opinion, the real deal is the creation of the modern equivalent of the work desk.


## The Challengers

### Salesforce, Jive


### Yammer/Microsoft


### Dropbox, Evernote, Asana, Trello


### et al
Wunderlist (lol but it has 1M android!), etc



## Automation

the real value is in automation

and integration with other systems

it should help the worker become more efficient. better organized. easy to know what's happening.
like twitter is the pulse of the internet, a well designed workdesk should be the pulse of my work life.
how? dashboards. overview of everything.


help you with a ever-more multi-tasking world
it's no longer self control. it's getting imposed. multiple tasks at hand
how cool would it be to have something save the state of whatever you were doing and then switch to another state
when you came back, you would be easily reminded of where you where and what you had to do next


## The Future

I won't dwelve into how the modern work desk should look like, but there are a few characteristics.

mobile mobile mobile: well, duh

will a one size fit all solution work? or will the solutions be segmented / tailored to specific types of professions?

I can say that a good example comes from [close.io](http://close.io). It's specifically directed to sales people
but it shows how good and useful a dashboard for a professional will look like.

github is an example of the work desk for software developers

webrtc (voice, video and p2p sharing)

?

As for the rest, I'll leave it to your imagination


As someone did not say: "I predict the future by learning from the mistakes of the past."
