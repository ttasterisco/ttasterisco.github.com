## Trends in Work
proliferation of task management system startups must mean something

there's asana, mail/dropbox, any.do, do.com, etc etc

many are trying to cater for what's now called "enterprise"

there's clearly a trend here, but what's the real deal?

many are tied to (or will be) email.

in my opinion, the real deal is the creation of the modern equivalent of the work desk.


## Work in the 20th Century (up until the 90s)

a lot of people in the world still have something resembling this:

## Work from 1990+

those that have migrated to the digital world look like this (actually they might be using outlook):

combined with

and tons of other documents laying around (pdfs, excels, docs, tabs open in the browser)

the low cost of the digital goods amplifies the old-world problems immensely

the direction the world <s>is taking</s> has taken is towards the web.
gmail, google drive, box, salesforce, evernote, yammer, etc

## The importance of email

communication is the central element in all this

that's why email will stick around - it's the best at allowing people to communicate freely
yes, it can be simplified. and it will
and that's why many startups are limpeting into it

## A Task as a unit of Work
so what is a task? it is this highly subjective thing that has to be done

it is natural that these startups are tackling this problem by starting at this generic element

but the evolution will, of course, be towards something bigger

the battle between asana, dropbox and evernote seems inevitable
they are all marching towards the same end



I won't dwelve into how the modern work desk should look like.

I can say that a good example comes from [close.io](http://close.io). It's specifically directed to sales people
but it shows how good and useful a dashboard for a professional will look like.

As for the rest, I'll leave it to your imagination
