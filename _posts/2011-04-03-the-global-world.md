the world is changing, as always did
but today we see the world moving into a uniform kind of place
cultures either kill or die
itâ€™s nature at its best.. survival of the fittest
the so called contra-cultures, the opposing movement is not strong enough to defend its interests

so what does this leads us to?
well at the start of the 21st century we have 3 cultures:

+ euro-american culture, so called modern culture who's area of influence is Europe, (South & North) America and the Orient (Japan, Korea, China) -----> Is Western Asia really the same?

+ the arab culture, holding into its values and morals is the only remaining opposition, even though i can count only years until its influence is taken.. currently still the most imposing force in the north african and west asian countries

+ africa, a continent devastated by wars and european greed is a continent that is currently around 1 century behind of the rest of the world.. with many countries still with authority problems and hunger killing millions it will take some time or someone with a big influence to introduce a new culture there..

with the world's resources disappearing at speed of light, and a country too small to handle so many its inevitable that a war will soon arise

if it will destroy this planet its doubtfull, but it will surely steady balance

why do i write this? because its the nature's way

we act as peons in nature's hand
as much as we try to deny it, nature still controls us, no mather what science says

nature is the behaviour of things, we see power trips come and go everywhere we look at
it will happen to us too (again)
