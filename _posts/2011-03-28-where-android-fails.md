Android = Freedom
That's just fucking Great

But what's holding Android back?

The Market
- market needs to be reworked
the app is still not good enough
what's with the awful search?
- make a 2 tier market: 1st tier - FFA (free for all), 2nd tier - Google Approved Apps.
this will keep freedom around, but Google Seal of Approval will give consumers the confidence (goodbye malware/spam/etc)
- android consumer mindset !=  ios consumer mindset
freemium vs paid
yes, they're not the same. if they were, they would've bought an iphone
fix whatever's wrong in the app-pay

There needs to be a better way to update Android
- cut the middle man - can we get rid of the handset manufacturers? yes they own the drivers, but there really needs to be a better way

The problem of malware and googleâ€™s integrated services
- google docs, spreadsheets, plus, photos, etc
