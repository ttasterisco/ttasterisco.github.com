2009-10, the rise of location based services
foursquare, gowalla, yelp, google places, facebook places, etc etc etc

foursquare is on the way to dominance

but it has just won 1 battle. the war is still on.

what use is it?
- good places database
- fun (that has some use)

is it enough?
- how is that monetizable?

an idea:
- contextualized-local-based advertisement / informations
- i've checked in this place. what's happening here? think augmented reality information apps (e.g. layar, etc)
give me more than 4sq tips. give me real-time information. useful stuff.
this can be used for ads -> checkin and know what promotions are happening in this store/mall/wtv
but not just ads. museums, art galleries, cinemas, theatres, etc

will it work? what does it need in order to work? venue-owners have to update this info. or maybe community based. or some automatic way (crawl info, parse & entity recognize, associate)

don't give me just the stuff that's happening here. give me info about stuff happening around here.

make it easy for venue owners/whoever to add this information
easy api so that it can be pluggable to some external app (these guys nowadays have to manage more than 1 social tool - twitter/facebook/etc) - work with the tool builders to promote it.

work on this angle for more than just the current event - give users access to event-history, comments, etc. easy to add future events. ask for € for event promotion.
in android/ios app, give me a what's happening around X tab.


big competitor: groupon?

make foursquare the app that I open up when I want to go out/am out
focus less on making user data public - that’s why I deleted you guys from my phone
