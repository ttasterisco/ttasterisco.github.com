title: Apple is the New Old Microsoft
summary: or, Developers, Developers, Developers

A story about the importance of controlling the platform that creators use in
their day to day lives (aka Steve Ballmer was right).

## This is How it Starts

Fun fact: roughly 85% of Facebook's ~10k employees (total) use Apple's Mac laptops,
with similar numbers at Google (~50k total employees) and I guess the same for most
Bay Area companies
[TODO: find stats of number of workers in technology companies in the bay area]
So this would be around ....... using Macs on their day to day as Software
Developers and Designers. Plus a few more "Marketing and Business people" and so on.
And that's just from some of the public companies of the Bay Area.

Why is this relevant? Because these people are not just anyone. They are creators
and influencers. They are the ones who build things that enable others to operate
in the digital economy. That means they build the software you use in your day to day
or they build the software that people make your software use.

For a better understanding of the impact of the dominance of the Operating System in
the software development ecossystem, let us consider how the cycle of software
development currently work.

[TODO: describe how software is developed and how open source software fits]

[TODO: hmmm... this needs to be better backed up]
First, Operating Systems have not become less important, as many might led us to believe,
due to the rise of Android and iOS. Yes, there are less and less people using tradiitonal
OSes. But the shift of the last ~10 years has had the consequence of making the traditional
OS even more important to the hands of their first and main users: Developers and Designers.






It is a fact that some of the most important open source software tools come
from Bay Area companies. And guess what runtime platform they target? Yes,
Mac OS X and Linux.

And outside the Bay Area? Let's take the example of one of the most important
OSS tools of the last 10 years: git. Guess where it runs natively? Yeap, Linux
and Mac. Guess which OS it had to be ported to and is still unofficially maintained?
Yeap, Windows! [TODO: check this]

And what's the importance of a simple source code version management tool? I mean,
Concurrent Versions System and Subversion did not target Windows in the beginning
either but that didn't stop Windows during the late 90s/early-mid 2ks, right?

Well, the difference with git is that the latter paved the way for the most popular
repository of Open Source Software, larger in dimension and cultural impact than
Sourceforge or Google Code ever had - Github (there's a reason why GitHub resum√© is
a thing but Sourceforge CV was never a thing).

Another very good example of how Microsoft lost the war is in Web Development.
Billy G. and his executives were clear in the future, they understood how the Web
would change Microsoft's business model and were quick to control it during the late
90s. But that wasn't enough, and Ballmer's Microsoft was not paying enough attention
to the rise of Server Side Web Development, namely Ruby on Rails. RoR was probably
the first big reason for Developers to switch into Mac machines - the exodus had
already started before RoR's appearence, but DHH's creation certainly made it
mainstream. Because if you wanted to work with RoR, you would surely use a Macbook
and TexMate.

And the trend has stayed with us: Want to use the newest/hippest/bestest programming
tools or languages? Even if they run on Windows from day 1 (arhem, Atom), guess what
platform the tutorials from the community will NOT be written for?

[TODO: sequence of thought...]

The lack of innovation in the Software Development front of the Microsoft Camp is so
clear, that I have trouble remembering what was the hippest programming language coming
from Microsoft? Probably F#, but that hasn't sticked. Heck, even Haskell got to be a lot
more popular. But go check the hype with Apple's Swift or Google's Go[lang] for a taste
of how it's currently done.

Microsoft is destined to lose major innovation waves unless there's a revolution in windows - and I dont
mean adding touch support - I mean the kind of revolution that made Macs use intel x86 - windows somehow
needa to support *nix and retrocompatibility with .net etc
Windows needs to bring the Software Developers and Designers back to their turf.


otherwise their billion+ dollar divisions of tools etc is going to
shrink into maintenance of old systems
doubt there's the courage for the change that's needed - even
russinovich (who's made his life in windows) jumped to azure - sign of
microsoft conceding defeat in the OS battle and consolidating arms
somewhere new?
but who in the valley thinks of microsoft? most of senior devs havent
touched windows in years and most new devs probably never even touched
windows!
without dev support, windows computers will be paperweights - not even
good for browsing the internet (see IE losing top browser use and
market share) - poor pepople will buy chromebooks
but more important, it affects all things microsoft: xbox, windows
phone and perhaps even azure (though a bit different case)
ballmer, was right - developers, developers, developers - so how did
he fail so miserably?
ironically their garden wall strategy might be backfiring - making
everything windows only (.net) instead of trying to be portable (java)
 has the gotcha that you must control the market to be successful -
once you slip (rails, ios), you're in big trouble



what about dogfooding? if most valley developers and designers don't work
with windows, that means what they're building will never get the same
level of experience as with other platforms - and no, testing if things
work in windows is not the same as constantly using windows (remember
facebook's android enforcement on their employees?)
do you really believe anyone developing webapps today has windows 8's
touch mode in mind when developing a website? I can assure you many do
put apple's retina display support as a priority though.


it's incredible how much microsoft has fallen in the server world
windows nt and windows server, once such dominant beasts in the server
side operating system world, has not paved the way for anything
relevant

and with that, the waterfall effect into their tools division - sql server,
exchange, billion dollar businesses, only survive today due to lock in


and the effects can trickle further
in an ever increasingly digital world, for non-digital companies, using the
right technological tools can give you an advantage over your competitors
and using the wrong tools can doom you
companies still locked into the microsoft-only world are most probably companies
that have trouble adapting to a new world and ripe for disruption
they might be doomed once upstart competitors lock in into their markets
even governments are moving away from microsoft

but is microsoft really to blame for all this?



What about Microsoft's new shift in paradigm? Instead of NIH, they are embracing the existing ecossystem
and opening up their platforms for these new tools: e.g. Azure
Why won't this work?

Remember Silverlight?
