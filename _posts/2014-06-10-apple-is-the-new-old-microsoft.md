title: Apple is the New Old Microsoft
summary: Or, Developers, Developers, Developers
---

A story on how Apple became our new Overlord, how that impacts Microsoft (the predecessor), and what might come next.<br/>
Also, a digression into the importance of controlling the platforms that creators use in their day to day lives. Yes, Steve Ballmer was right.


## Apple
<!--

- how this power was achieved
- the power that being the "arms dealer" has
-->

Fun fact[^1]: roughly 85% of Facebook's ~10k employees use Apple laptops, with similar numbers at Google (~50k total employees) and I guess all of the other tech companies[^2] in the Bay Area.
This is probably over 300k people using Macs on their day to day as Software Developers, Designers, "Marketing and Business people" and so on.

[^1]: This is actually a very precise number. Thank you insiders.

[^2]: Except Microsoft SF and Microsoft SV.

Just.In.The.S.F.Bay.Area.











### Who Cares?
But why is this "drop in the ocean" relevant? Who cares what laptop they use or what Operating System they run if Windows is still present in ~91% of the desktops and laptops[^3]?

[^3]: Desktop OS Market Share as of August 2014 according to Net Applications http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems

Well, anyone in the Software World should care, because these people are not just anyone. They are creators and influencers.
They are the ones who build things that enable others to operate in the digital economy.
That means they either build the software you use in your day to day, or they build the software that people who make your software use.

For a better understanding on the impact of the dominance of the Operating System in the software development ecossystem, let us consider how the cycle of software development currently works.

### The Creation Process
[TODO: describe how software is developed and how open source software fits]

It is a fact that some of the most important open source software tools come from Bay Area companies.
And guess what runtime platform they target? Yes, Mac OS X and Linux.

And outside the Bay Area? Let's take the example of one of the most important OSS tools of the last 10 years: git
Guess where it runs natively? Yeap, Linux and Mac.
Guess which OS it had to be ported to and is still unofficially maintained?
Yeap, Windows! [TODO: check this]

And what's the importance of a simple source code version management tool?
I mean, Concurrent Versions System and Subversion did not target Windows in the beginning either but that didn't stop Windows during the late 90s/early-mid 2ks, right?

Well, the difference with git is that the latter paved the way for the most popular repository of Open Source Software, larger in dimension and cultural impact than Sourceforge or Google Code ever had - Github (there's a reason why GitHub resum√© is a thing but Sourceforge CV was never a thing).

[TODO: go on...]

### But The Workstation Is Not Dead
[TODO: hmmm... this needs to be better backed up]
First, Operating Systems have not become less important, as many might led us to believe, due to the rise of Android and iOS.
Yes, there are less and less people using tradiitonal OSes.
But the shift of the last ~10 years has had the consequence of making the traditional OS even more important to the hands of their main users: Developers and Designers.

It is a tad ironic that the people who build the software that powers your phones and tablets do not use phones and tablets for building that software.
Yet. Or maybe never or not anytime soon, due to physical limitations?

And here lies the problem for Microsoft.

[TODO: ...?]




























## Microsoft

### Getting Disrupted, the Microsoft Way
These days, it's too easy to mock Microsoft - once the most feared company in the Computer World, perhaps even more than IBM.
But Microsoft really seems to have had the stars aligned against it.

First, the Web and the Open Source movement were picking up.

At the same time, the DOJ began its Anti-Monopoly investigation.

And when things were settling down, boom, the iPhone lands. And Android. And the iPad. And Amazon Web Services.

What feels like an eternity was actually a less than 15 year timespan.

Don't get me wrong, it's not like it couldn't have happened to a nicer company (rah!). And it's not as if Microsoft is not to blame.


What seems to have failed is that Microsoft was too slow to move. And it bet on the wrong things.

Another very good example of how Microsoft lost the war is in Web Development.
Billy G. and his executives were clear in the future, they understood how the Web would change Microsoft's business model and were quick to control it during the late 90s.
But that wasn't enough, and Ballmer's Microsoft was not paying enough attention to the rise of Server Side Web Development, namely Ruby on Rails.
RoR was probably the first big reason for Developers to switch into Mac machines - the exodus had already started before RoR's appearence, but DHH's creation certainly made it mainstream.
Because if you wanted to work with RoR, you would surely use a Macbook and TexMate.

And the trend has stayed with us: Want to use the newest/hippest/bestest programming tools or languages?
Even if they run on Windows from day 1 (arhem, Atom), guess what platform the tutorials from the community will NOT be written for?

[TODO: sequence of thought...]

The lack of innovation in the Software Development front of the Microsoft Camp is so clear, that I have trouble remembering what was the hippest programming language coming from Microsoft?
Probably F#, but that hasn't sticked. Heck, even Haskell got to be a lot more popular.
But go check the hype with Apple's Swift or Google's Go[lang] for a taste of how it's currently done.

Microsoft is destined to lose major innovation waves unless there's a revolution in windows - and I dont mean adding touch support - I mean the kind of revolution that made Macs use intel x86 - windows somehow needa to support *nix and retrocompatibility with .net etc Windows needs to bring the Software Developers and Designers back to their turf.


otherwise their billion+ dollar divisions of tools etc is going to shrink into maintenance of old systems
doubt there's the courage for the change that's needed - even russinovich (who's made his life in windows) jumped to azure - sign of microsoft conceding defeat in the OS battle and consolidating arms somewhere new?
but who in the valley thinks of microsoft? most of senior devs havent touched windows in years and most new devs probably never even touched windows!
without dev support, windows computers will be paperweights - not even good for browsing the internet (see IE losing top browser use and market share) - poor pepople will buy chromebooks
but more important, it affects all things microsoft: xbox, windows phone and perhaps even azure (though a bit different case)
ballmer, was right - developers, developers, developers - so how did he fail so miserably?
ironically their garden wall strategy might be backfiring - making everything windows only (.net) instead of trying to be portable (java) has the gotcha that you must control the market to be successful - once you slip (rails, ios), you're in big trouble



what about dogfooding? if most valley developers and designers don't work with windows, that means what they're building will never get the same level of experience as with other platforms - and no, testing if things
work in windows is not the same as constantly using windows (remember facebook's android enforcement on their employees?)
do you really believe anyone developing webapps today has windows 8's touch mode in mind when developing a website? I can assure you many do put apple's retina display support as a priority though.


it's incredible how much microsoft has fallen in the server world
windows nt and windows server, once such dominant beasts in the server side operating system world, has not paved the way for anything relevant

and with that, the waterfall effect into their tools division - sql server, exchange, billion dollar businesses, only survive today due to lock in


and the effects can trickle further
in an ever increasingly digital world, for non-digital companies, using the right technological tools can give you an advantage over your competitors and using the wrong tools can doom you companies still locked into the microsoft-only world are most probably companies that have trouble adapting to a new world and ripe for disruption they might be doomed once upstart competitors lock in into their markets even governments are moving away from microsoft

but is microsoft really to blame for all this?



What about Microsoft's new shift in paradigm? Instead of NIH, they are embracing the existing ecossystem
and opening up their platforms for these new tools: e.g. Azure
Why won't this work?

Remember Silverlight?
