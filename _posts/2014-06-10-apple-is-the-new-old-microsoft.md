title: Apple is the New Old Microsoft
summary: or, Developers, Developers, Developers
---

Fun fact: roughly 85% of Facebook's ~10k employees (total) use Mac, with similar numbers at
Google (~50k total employees) and I guess at most valley companies. So this would be around
....... using Macs on their day to day as Software Developers, Designers, Marketing and Business
"people".

Why is this relevant? Let's consider how the cycle of software development currently work.

[describe how software is developed and how open source software fits]


Some of the most important open source software tools come from Valley companies. [note ...]

Guess what runtime platform they target? Mac OS X and Linux.

Let's take the example of one of the most OSS tools (that wasn't built in the Valley): git
Guess where it runs natively? Linux and Mac. Guess which OS it had to ported to by someone not named Linus?
Windows!

Let's take another example, this time of hosting. What's the largest repository of OSS? Github!

Want to use the newest/hippest/bestest programming tools/languages? Even if they run on Windows from day 1
(arhem, Atom), guess what platform the tutorials from the community will NOT be written for? yeap, Windows...

Remember the hippest programming language coming from Microsoft? Typescript? F#? Probably C# back in 2003?
Go check the hype with apple's Swift or Google's Go[lang]

Microsoft is destined to lose major innovation waves unless there's a revolution in windows - and I dont
mean adding touch support - I mean the kind of revolution that made Macs use intel x86 - windows somehow
needa to support *nix and retrocompatibility with .net etc
Windows needs to bring the Software Developers and Designers back to their turf.


otherwise their billion+ dollar divisions of tools etc is going to
shrink into maintenance of old systems
doubt there's the courage for the change that's needed - even
russinovich (who's made his life in windows) jumped to azure - sign of
microsoft conceding defeat in the OS battle and consolidating arms
somewhere new?
but who in the valley thinks of microsoft? most of senior devs havent
touched windows in years and most new devs probably never even touched
windows!
without dev support, windows computers will be paperweights - not even
good for browsing the internet (see IE losing top browser use and
market share) - poor pepople will buy chromebooks
but more important, it affects all things microsoft: xbox, windows
phone and perhaps even azure (though a bit different case)
ballmer, was right - developers, developers, developers - so how did
he fail so miserably?
ironically their garden wall strategy might be backfiring - making
everything windows only (.net) instead of trying to be portable (java)
 has the gotcha that you must control the market to be successful -
once you slip (rails, ios), you're in big trouble



what about dogfooding? if most valley developers and designers don't work
with windows, that means what they're building will never get the same
level of experience as with other platforms - and no, testing if things
work in windows is not the same as constantly using windows (remember
facebook's android enforcement on their employees?)
do you really believe anyone developing webapps today has windows 8's
touch mode in mind when developing a website? I can assure you many do
put apple's retina display support as a priority though.





What about Microsoft's new shift in paradigm? Instead of NIH, they are embracing the existing ecossystem
and opening up their platforms for these new tools: e.g. Azure
Why won't this work?

Remember Silverlight?
