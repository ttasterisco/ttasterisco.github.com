title: Apple is the New Old Microsoft
summary: or Developers, Developers, Developers
---

fun fact: ~85% of facebook's 10k employees use mac, similar numbers at
google (50k total employees) and I guess at most valley companies
why is this relevant? most open source software comes from valley companies
guess what runtime platform they target? mac os x/linux
example: git - guess where it runs natively? linux/mac. guess where it
had to ported to by someone not named linus? windows!
guess where most oss is hosted at? github!
want to use the newest/hippest/bestest programming tools/languages?
even if they run on windows, guess what platform the tutorials from
the community will NOT be written for? yeap, windows...
and let's not forget ios... remember the last time microsoft
successful programming language? not typescript, not f#, c# maybe back
in 2003? go check the hype with apple's swift or google's golang
microsoft is destined to lose major innovation waves unless there's a
revolution in windows - and I dont mean adding touch support - I mean
the kind of revolution that made macs use intel x86 - windows somehow
needa to support *nix and retrocompatibility with .net etc
otherwise their billion+ dollar divisions of tools etc is going to
shrink into maintenance of old systems
doubt there's the courage for the change that's needed - even
russinovich (who's made his life in windows) jumped to azure - sign of
microsoft conceding defeat in the OS battle and consolidating arms
somewhere new?
but who in the valley thinks of microsoft? most of senior devs havent
touched windows in years and most new devs probably never even touched
windows!
without dev support, windows computers will be paperweights - not even
good for browsing the internet (see IE losing top browser use and
market share) - poor pepople will buy chromebooks
but more important, it affects all things microsoft: xbox, windows
phone and perhaps even azure (though a bit different case)
ballmer, was right - developers, developers, developers - so how did
he fail so miserably?
ironically their garden wall strategy might be backfiring - making
everything windows only (.net) instead of trying to be portable (java)
 has the gotcha that you must control the market to be successful -
once you slip (rails, ios), you're in big trouble
