The importance of a decentralized digital cryptocurrency in a digital and service based society, or why Bitcoin will win.

November'13 has seen another rebirth for Bitcoin. The value has soared and with it, the number of mainstream media appearences and discussion around the Globe.
Here, I argue that Bitcoin will be the cherry on top of the Digital Economy, as envisioned by its creator.

## Neo-Money
Bitcoin certainly seems too good to be true. Created by an anonymous crypto-genius with the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto" and named with the most simple concatenation possible ("bit" + "coin" - why wasn't this taken yet?!), it came to "disrupt" the old money establishment that has been abusing the trust of consumers. How much more Hollywoodesque can you get?

In its [v0.1 introduction](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source) in February 2009, "Satoshi" writes twice about the current impracticality caused by the Banking system on micro-payments and how Bitcoin's properties could overcome this.

While Bitcoin can indeed do that (and in my opinion this will be the main application), the question is why would it become the currency of the internet?

### Bitcoin and the Digital Economy

To me, most of the criticism on Bitcoin shows a lack of vision. They commonly attack Bitcoin for what it currently is instead of what it will be. And what it will be is the Engine of the Digital Society.

It's hard to object that First World Countries are Digital Societies. The population is controlled by GPS, Smartphones, Tablets, Laptops, Desktops, SmartTVs, 4th Gen Gaming Consoles, Smart Watches, Body Tracking Devices, Smart Cars and so on.

Yet we still operate with physical cash or it's port into the digital world, that carries the bureaucracy of the physical world.

But Bitcoin (or any kind of digital currency that is a first class citizen) has the potential to break free from that bureaucracy and unlock ---the power of computers---. And power might that be?






## The Lack of a "Killer App"
The main critic of Bitcoin is that, for now, it is technically useless. You can't do anything real with it, yet.
And for a long time, I too thought this was what would make or break Bitcoin. Either a real application of Bitcoin would appear in the near-future or people would give up on Bitcoin.

But let's analyze another similar digital and distributed system: The Internet. There was never a single killer app for the internet. It was initially used for communication (email), announcing your existence to a limited amount of people in the world (webpages) and discussion boards (forums) were imported from the BBS world.
But today, it is used to interact with others in real time (chat, games), listen to music (Spotify et al), watch tv/movies (Hulu, Netflix), share digital goods (Dropbox), buy things (Amazon), write (blogs), read (newspapers) and learn (MOOCs, Wikipedia), collaborate (Github) and much more. An entire ecosystem of applications has developed on something that was once also mocked as a joke.

What happened was that enough resources were spent on the Internet (leading to a huge bubble) that the Internet became calcified.
The digital roads were built during the 90s. And during the 00s, the houses and businesses were built.

And that might also happen with Bitcoin. It is fairly obvious that a lot of resources are being invested into Bitcoin (and I'm not talking about money directly).
We are currently in the infrastructure period.

## Speculation
Following the critique of the lack of real applications for Bitcoin, comes the critique that the value of Bitcoin is speculation. It might be for now.
But it also might be betting on the long term and the #win of Bitcoin. That's where I (and many others) am. I'm buying Bitcoin because I think it will win. And I'm working on it too.

Yes, Bitcoin doesn't feed us. But 20 years ago, if you told someone that you would get insanely payed while creating totally virtual things, would your mother believe you?






## Emergence
Another force pushing Bitcoin is the Rise of the Individual. Freelancing is more and more chosen as a lifestyle. Those who can afford such a lifestyle (generally individuals who have the luxury of choosing what to do - either because of their quality or just because they happen to possess skills that are in high demand) might want an alternative currency that has no borders nor historical-taxations. Get payed in Bitcoins and go live in Chile, Argentina, Thailand, Russia, Germany or the US.

Think of a world where the Internet of Things is a reality. Do you want to keep going to the ATM or Bank to pay your utilities?
Just like we have automatic payments from our Banks, imagine a world where you have this with Bitcoin. Imagine a world where all your digital services are payed through Bitcoin, instead of your Bank. Github, Digital Ocean, Amazon, Your-favorite-newspaper, etc all linked to your Bitcoin service that manages your payments.

Now glue everything together.

## Bitcoin &lt;-&gt; Real World
So it seems obvious that it will only be a matter of time until the real world starts accepting Bitcoin or some service comes and translates it for the users.

By then, we will be able to use Bitcoin to pay for orders on Amazon.


## Money or Resource?
Is Bitcoin like dollars or like gold? That was somthing that Satoshi immediately wrote about:

> In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.

My belief is that it is none (or both)! It's not like gold as of today, but more like gold as of millenia ago.

The parallel is here:
In a world where regulation was pretty much inexistant when compared to today, direct exchange of goods or through a precious metal was the norm.
You traded with the farmer who farmed that wheat, the blacksmith who built your tools. Not the 10th intermediary.

Today, we trade our digital services directly with our service providers/manufactorers. Fortunately we don't have to deal with GitHub through a 5th middle-man.
But we still pay through USD/Euro. Now imagine if you're new indie musician who hasn't signed with any label but has a small amount of followers all around the globe thanks to Soundcloud and Youtube. And you would want some support for travel expenses for touring and what not. Instead of asking for money - that would be Yuan from your Chinese fans, Dollars from your American fans, Pounds from your British fans, Euros from your German fans - what if you just asked for some Bitcoin? It wouldn't take days to be processed and you wouldn't need to get it converted into your "current home" currency. Now replace musician with Software Developer (ever heard of gittip?) or anyone on Kickstarter.

## Threats

### Security.
Wallets/Exchanges have to level up and implement the most secure systems possible. Or fail and lose the confidence of the world.
It is only inevitable for the number of attacks to rise as the value of Bitcoin increases. But stopping the attacks is possible. And once a tall enough barrier is setup,
most attacks will stop. The fact that this is a digital currency could also prove useful to revert attacks.
It would prove very useful to revert a transation by the majority of nodes agreeing to do it. Just as easy as the attack happened, it would be easy for the coins to go back to the original owner.

### Regulation AKA Politics and Old Money Interests


## Where are we? Where do we go?
Nobody knows.

I've got say I'm on my way... down?

We might be in the beginning of our 1999 equivalent bubble, that is, around 96, right after the release of Windows'95 and the gate opening via IE3.0.
It seems inevitable that a huge bubble will occur, given that the hoppers are jumping into the bandwagon.

But just like then, it is upon the truly vested interests to continue the development of this next-next-big-thing.

Even if Bitcoin fails to become the de facto currency of the Digital Economy, the box has now been totally opened (Pandora couldn't be happier) and the possibilities that can be unlocked are yet to be dreamed of.
