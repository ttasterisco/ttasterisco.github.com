title: Hello GitHub Pages and Jekyll
summary: (writing-in-progress) How I've setup this website in GitHub Pages, using Jekyll, and how the workflow I intend to use for my writings works (hint - it's just like gitflow).
---

Woohoo, I have a <s>blog</s> website.

I'm going to describe how I did it and how I intend to work.


## Why github pages/jekyll?
not only it's pretty cool

it's useful as hell

if you commit often, you'll have all your writing changes available

highly customizable

if you're a coder, you can use a known workflow


## How GitHub Pages works
create the initial repo ```username.github.com```


## How Jekyll works
the folder structure
* ```_includes/``` --- partial templates
* ```_layouts/``` --- templates
* ```_posts/``` --- your posts
  * ```2013-03-15-hello-github-pages-and-jekyll.md``` --- the posts must have this format
  * ```2013-03-16-some-other-post.md``` --- I had to add this cause jekyll can't format this correctly
* ```_site/``` --- auto-generated by jekyll, it's where the built files are
* ```_config.yml``` --- configuration for jekyll
* ```index.html```

you can also throw in
* ```404.html``` --- attention, won't work in localhost unless you do some tricks
* ```CNAME``` --- for your custom domain
* ```atom.xml``` --- rss ftw
* ```.gitignore``` --- don't forget this before you push to github, ignore ```_sites```

your content files will need a yaml front matter header


## Customizing
create your own layouts

accessing template variables (```page```, ```site```, etc)



## Testing
```gem install jekyll```

```jekyll --server```


## Workflow

Basically, it's [gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

master contains the live version of the website.

each post goes into a writings-in-progress/name branch.

develop should contain the stable work in progress, but I pretend to use it as a local preview of all the writings (all the wip branches).
