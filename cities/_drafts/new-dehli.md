2015

it started at night
I thought you were a man
but then came the day
and you were a woman

and you asked me what were my plans
and you joined in my plans

and I hope you enjoyed the day
the long walks around the city
in the burning sun
the lunch at Dunkin Donuts
the unexpected turns
the Indira Gandhi house
the eventful metro ride

I really hope you enjoyed the day
I hope I did not act in an inappropriate way
The end was so abrupt

I will cherish the memories forever
Aviv
